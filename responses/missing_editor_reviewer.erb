It looks like you don't have an editor and reviewer assigned yet so I can't start the review. Try one or more of these commands:

```
# Change editorial assignment
@uw-bot assign @username as editor

# Assign a GitHub user as the sole reviewer of this submission
@uw-bot assign @username as reviewer

# Add a GitHub user to the reviewers of this submission
@uw-bot add @username as reviewer


EDITORIAL TASKS

# All commands can be run on a non-default branch, to do this pass a custom 
# branch name by following the command with `from branch custom-branch-name`.
# For example:


# Remind an author or reviewer to return to a review after a
# certain period of time (supported units days and weeks)
@uw-bot remind @reviewer in 2 weeks


```
