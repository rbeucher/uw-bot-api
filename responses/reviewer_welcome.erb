Hello human, I'm @uw-bot, a robot that can help you with some common editorial tasks. <%= reviewer.join(', ') %> it looks like you're currently assigned to review this model :tada:.

**:star: Important :star:**

If you haven't already, you should seriously consider unsubscribing from GitHub notifications for this (https://github.com/<%= nwo %>) repository. As a reviewer, you're probably currently watching this repository which means for GitHub's default behaviour you will receive notifications (emails) for all reviews ðŸ˜¿

To fix this do the following two things:

1. Set yourself as 'Not watching' https://github.com/<%= nwo %>:
2. You may also like to change your default settings for this watching repositories in your GitHub profile here: https://github.com/settings/notifications
