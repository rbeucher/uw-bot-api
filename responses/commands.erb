Here are some things you can ask me to do (I'm kind of lazy for now):

```
# List all of UW-bot's capabilities
@uw-bot commands

# Assign a GitHub user as the sole reviewer of this submission
@uw-bot assign @username as reviewer

# Add a GitHub user to the reviewers of this submission
@uw-bot add @username as reviewer

# Re-invite a reviewer (if they can't update checklists)
@uw-bot re-invite @username as reviewer

# Remove a GitHub user from the reviewers of this submission
@uw-bot remove @username as reviewer

# List of editor GitHub usernames
@uw-bot list editors

# List of reviewers together with programming language preferences and domain expertise
@uw-bot list reviewers

# Change editorial assignment
@uw-bot assign @username as editor

# Set the Model archive DOI at the top of the issue e.g.
@uw-bot set 10.0000/zenodo.00000 as archive

# Set the Model version at the top of the issue e.g.
@uw-bot set v1.0.1 as version

```
